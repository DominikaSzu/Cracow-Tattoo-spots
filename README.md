# MyReads Project

This is the application which gives the user a possibility to organize his reading plans.

It contains three shelves, on which the user can segregate the books:
* Currently Reading: for the books the user is reading at the moment,
* Want To Read: to track all the books he is planning to read in the future,
* Read: for all the books he has already read.

What's more, the application gives the possibility not only to organize the books but also to search for another.

In the right bottom corner, the user can find a "+" which will give him a possibility to search for new positions and add them to one of the three shelves.
